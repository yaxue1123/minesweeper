            <ul>
                <li>
                    You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain <i class='fas fa-bomb'></i>, others don't. 
                    If you left click on a square containing a bomb, you lose, and all <i class='fas fa-bomb'></i> will appear, and 
                    the fields that you wrongly marked as bomb will show as <i class='fas fa-times'></i>. 
                    If you manage to find all bombs(mark them as <i class='far fa-flag'></i>), you win.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Left click</em></strong> to reveal a field you find safe, and a number of 
                    how many bombs around this field (above, below, left, right and 4 diagonals) will appear. 
                    If this number is 0, then automatically open the 8 adjacent fields since it's safe to do so.
                    When a clicked field has same already marked adjacent fields as it indicates, left click the revealed 
                    field will automatically click on surrounding fields. If the marked has a wrong one, then fail. This can help
                    you quickly clear fields instead of left clicking one by one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Right click</em></strong> or <strong><em>shift + left click </em></strong> 
                    to mark a field that you think has bomb, the a <i class='far fa-flag'></i> will appear to remind you there is a bomb. 
                    Repeat once to cancel mark, but a <i class="fas fa-question"></i> will appear, which
                    you can use to mark unsured area. Repeat again to cancel the <i class="fas fa-question"></i> and 
                    return to original status.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the game panel, you are allowed to customize your minefield by inputting numbers. The height should be 
                    within [8, 30], and width [8, 40]. The total bomb should be [1, height * width - 1]. Once your input your desirable
                    three fields, click new game button to start a new game. You can start a new game at any time. 
                </li>
                <li>
                   There are also three default set difficulty levels including beginner, Intermediate and Expert that you can choose
                   from the drop down menu, which have 8 * 8 * 10, 16 * 16 * 40, and 30 * 40 * 160 respectively regarding height * width * bombs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The number of unmarked bombs and a timer are shown above the minefield. The timer starts once you click on the minefield, or 
                    click the new game button, or choose any default difficulty level from the drop down menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you win a game, you will get a score calculated based on time and difficulty (no fancy algorithm, just a simple 
                    calculation which I think makes some sense, find it from the source code haha). Click scoreboard on the top menu to see 
                    all your score history ranked from high to low (no global score record since this is only a front-end game and no score 
                    record before your last refresh of the page).
                </li>
                <li>
                    This game currently only supports web version (you need play it in the browser of your computer), and make sure your 
                    window is big enough for the expert level (or the minefield will wrap and no way to play).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ps: When I read the requirements of this assignments, I was thinking why it was so lengthy, can't KMP make it 
                    simpler? Well, when I started to write this instruction on my own, I came to realize it is impossible to be succinct.
                    Anyway, forget about the wordy instruction and a list trying to be logical... Just start you game and have fun! <i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i>

            History
        </h1>
        <p>
            Minesweeper is based off the original Windows version of the game first released by Microsoft 
            in 1990. Every release of Windows since has had a version of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history of Minesweeper goes back to the early 80's with many mine-type 
            games being released in that period. The earliest proven ancestor of Minesweeper 
            is Mined-Out, which was released for the Sinclair Spectrum in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game evolved over the 1980's into the game we love today. Most of the key features 
            like right-click (to mark a mine) and numbers (showing you adjacent bombs) evolved in the 
            last 2-3 years of the 80's.
        </p>
        <p>
            This browser based version is developed by Yaxue Guo for the purpose of UNC-CH COMP 426 assignment. 
            I designed this version in the principle of simpleness in style as well as completeness of function. 
            By the way, no fancy js animation because less is more (actually because I don't have time and 
            the 426 final is coming next week <i class="far fa-sad-cry"></i>).
